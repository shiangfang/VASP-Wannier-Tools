Ab initio tight-binding Hamiltonian for transition metal dichalcogenides
by Shiang Fang, Rodrick Kuate Defo, Sharmila N. Shirodkar, Simon Lieu, Georgios A. Tritsaris, and Efthimios Kaxiras
code version: July 2017


This code package includes the MATLAB scripts to generate Hamiltonian of
monolayer TMDCs as in the reference article. The script:

TBH_monolayer_band.m

TBH_monolayer_band_SOC.m

are the main scripts to plot the band structure without and with spin
 orbit coupling terms. The rest of the scripts are necessary functions.
